## Overview

This skill includes executable code that Claude can run to perform specific operations. The code files provide deterministic, reliable functionality that complements Claude's natural language capabilities.

## Code Files

This skill includes the following code files:

- `script.py` - [Description of what this script does]
  - Usage: `python script.py [arguments]`
  - Output: [Describe what the script outputs]

## When to Use Code

Claude should execute the code files when:

- [Describe specific scenarios when code execution is needed]
- [List conditions that trigger code usage]
- [Explain why code is better than token generation for this task]

## Usage Instructions

1. [Step-by-step instructions for Claude on how to use the code]
2. [How to handle input/output]
3. [Error handling considerations]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario Name]

```bash
# Command example
python script.py input.txt output.txt
```

**Expected Result:** [Describe what should happen]

### Example 2: [Another Scenario]

[Provide another example with code usage]
